BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
•	Run the command make source_file.o to create an object file that is a combination of object files for all C files. 
•	Run the command make my_project to create an executable that converts a specified bitmap source image to a TIFF destination image. Note that the source image must be added to the present directory and the file pointer must point to the specified source image. 
•	Run the command ./my_project to run the executable file. 
•	The new tiff image will be under the file destination_image.tiff. 
•	Run the command make clean to delete the executable file and all object files from the directory.

A NOTE ON THE IMAGES:

The images that are included in the final submission file may or may not open on the photo viewers on some machines
in this case please try to open them in VS Code itself using the photo viewer built into VS Code.
The Converted TIFF images should however open on most photo viewers.
